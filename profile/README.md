### What are we doing exactly?

We work on Sky related (software) projects for example translating the game to unsupported languages and comparing readable files after each update. Nothing harmful and nothing cheating related. We don't like cheats and we support TGC in multiple ways. The owner of this organization is a regular season pass buyer. ðŸ˜„
