### What are we doing exactly?

We work on Sky related (software) projects, for example translating the game to unsupported languages and keeping track of game updates. Nothing harmful and nothing cheating related. We don't like cheats and we support TGC in multiple ways. The owner of this organization is a regular season pass buyer. ðŸ˜„
